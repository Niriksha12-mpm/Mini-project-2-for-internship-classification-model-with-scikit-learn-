code builds and evaluates a classification model using the Random Forest algorithm with scikit-learn:

1. Import Libraries: Essential libraries for data handling, model training, and evaluation are imported.


2. Load Dataset: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.


3. Preprocess Data: Features and target variables are separated; data is split into training and test sets.


4. Feature Scaling: The feature data is scaled to standardize the range of values.


5. Train Model: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the scaled training data.


6. Predict and Evaluate: The model makes predictions on the test data, and its performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
